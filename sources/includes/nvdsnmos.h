/**
 * @defgroup  nvdsnmos  Networked Media Open Specifications (NMOS) API
 *
 * Defines the DeepStream NMOS utility library (NvDsNmos) API.
 *
 * The NvDsNmos utility library provides the APIs to create, destroy and
 * internally manage an <a href="https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/">NMOS</a> Node for a DeepStream
 * application.
 *
 * The library can automatically discover and register with an NMOS Registry
 * on the network using the <a href="https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04/">AMWA IS-04</a> Registration API.
 *
 * The library provides callbacks for NMOS events such as <a
 * href="https://specs.amwa.tv/is-05/">AMWA IS-05</a> Connection API requests from an NMOS
 * Controller. These callbacks can be used to update running DeepStream pipelines with new transport
 * parameters, for example.
 *
 * NvDsNmos currently supports Senders and Receivers for uncompressed Video
 * and Audio, i.e., SMPTE ST 2110-20 and SMPTE ST 2110-30 streams.
 *
 * The NvDsNmos library supports the following specifications, using the <a
 * href="https://github.com/sony/nmos-cpp">Sony nmos-cpp</a> implementation:
 * - <a href="https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04/">AMWA IS-04 NMOS Discovery and Registration
 * Specification</a> v1.3
 * - <a href="https://specs.amwa.tv/is-05/">AMWA IS-05 NMOS Device Connection Management
 * Specification</a> v1.1
 * - <a href="https://specs.amwa.tv/is-09/">AMWA IS-09 NMOS System Parameters Specification</a> v1.0
 * - <a href="https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-004-01/">AMWA BCP-004-01 NMOS Receiver Capabilities</a> v1.0
 * - Session Description Protocol conforming to SMPTE ST 2110-20 and -30
